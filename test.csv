But the staff was so horrible to us.,0
To be completely fair  the only redeeming factor was the food  which was above average  but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.,0
The food is uniformly exceptional  with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating  whether it's on the menu or not.,1
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.,1
For those that go once and don't enjoy it  all I can say is that they just don't get it.,1
Not only was the food outstanding  but the little 'perks' were great.,1
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.,0
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).,1
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture  both chewy yet not gummy.,1
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.,1
i've noticed megadeth  mr. scruff  st. germain  traditional vietnamese songs  black sabbath  jay-z  and daft punk all being played.,1
They did not have mayonnaise  forgot our toast  left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet)  below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.,0
It took half an hour to get our check  which was perfect since we could sit  have drinks and talk!,0
The design and atmosphere is just as good.,1
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.,1
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.,1
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.,1
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!,1
He can't help  they're bought up so fast.,1
Secondly  on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.,0
i have eaten here a handful of times  for no reason besides sheer convenience.,1
Obviously run by folks who know a pie.,1
We were very disappointed.,0
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE.,1
I really liked this place.,1
I will be going back very soon.,1
All the money went into the interior decoration  none of it went to the chefs.,0
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.,1
I asked for seltzer with lime  no ice.,1
It was pretty inexpensive too.,1
Will not be back.,0
Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience  with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.,1
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.,1
Best of all is the warm vibe  the owner is super friendly and service is fast.,1
This isn't a value joint.,0
Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.,0
From the incredible food  to the warm atmosphere  to the friendly service  this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.,1
Great food at REASONABLE prices  makes for an evening that can't be beat!,1
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.,1
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.,1
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.,1
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.,1
You'll adore it.,1
Two words: Free wine.,1
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.,0
The quantity is also very good  you will come out satisfied.,1
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.,0
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.,1
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers  we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.,1
Raga's is a romantic  cozy restaurant.,1
The fried rice is amazing here.,1
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels  puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing  and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.,1
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.,1
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.,1
At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.,1
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.,1
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.,0
The wine list is excellent.,1
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.,1
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before  and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).,1
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.,1
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.,1
Whem asked  we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.,0
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.,1
Nice atmosphere  the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.,1
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!,1
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.,1
Fabulous service  fantastic food  and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.,1
Not what I wanted to hear.,0
Try the lasagnette appetizer.,1
Pricey  but worth a try  at least once.,1
I've been there a few times  and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.,0
I liked the beer selection!,1
Great food  good size menu  great service and an unpretensious setting.,1
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.,1
Can't wait to go back.,1
I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.,1
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.,1
With the great variety on the menu   I eat here often and never get bored .,1
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.,0
If you are a carnivore  come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been.,1
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.,1
Not too crazy about their sake martini.,0
Great bagels  spreads and a good place to hang out in.,1
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice  and sometimes not.,0
whoever the jazz duo was  they were on POINT.,1
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.,1
This place is a great bargain.,1
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.,1
Unfortunately  the food is outstanding  but everything else about this restaurant is the pits.,1
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.,1
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.,1
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks  swirl them around  and eat.,1
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.,1
My husbands was perfect  my was well done and dry.,0
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly  helpful  and willing to the extra mile for a customer.,0
The pizza was pretty good and huge.,1
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in NYC.,0
The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese  though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.,1
I heartily recommend.,1
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones.,1
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.,1
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.,1
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.,0
The atmosphere is unheralded  the service impecible  and the food magnificant.,1
We ordered the special  grilled branzino  that was so infused with bone  it was difficult to eat.,0
The wait staff is friendly  and the food has gotten better and better!,1
This place  which is only a few months old  is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!,1
It may be a bit packed on weekends  but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.,1
This place is so much fun.,1
I was glad I did.,1
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.,1
I've never been treated so rudely.,0
I'll be back soon.,1
Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.,1
Went inside and I started to get excited.,1
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.,0
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.,0
However  it is jus too good to not praise it.,1
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason.,1
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.,0
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.,1
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.,1
If you wrote a bad review  it's because you don't understand what Rao's is all about.,1
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from  but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!,0
but overall i give it a 10,1
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat  with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll  it is well worth the price you pay for them.,1
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC.,1
I have tried to make reservations  but both times  the hostess didn't have my name.,0
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).,1
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.,1
This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.,1
This restaurant used to be pretty decent.,0
An oasis of refinement: Food  though somewhat uneven  often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.,1
If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare  you'll love Artisanal!,1
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.,1
Some baby pizzas get their wish.,1
Plenty of choices to make your own creation.,1
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.,0
I was there on sat.,1
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it,1
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.,1
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up.,1
From the terrible service  to the bland food  not to mention the unaccommodating managers  the overall experience was horrible.,0
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.,1
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen.,0
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end.,1
Nice restaurant overall  with classic upscale Italian decor.,1
Not impressed with the food.,0
The entire dining experience was wonderful!,1
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.,1
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.,1
Order the panang duck  it's fantastic.,1
Food is usually very good  though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.,0
Other than the crappy service from two individuals  it's great.,0
What more can you ask for?,1
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.,1
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.,1
You are treated just like royality.,1
There's nice and quiet  small but enough for 6 (or more).,1
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.,1
I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.,0
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon  Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.,1
Yes  they use fancy ingredients  but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.,0
Looking from the outside in  one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really  that's what it is).,0
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.,1
I look forward to eating here again,1
I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste.,1
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price.,1
A glass of Leaping Lizard  a glass of prosecco  and the mussels had everything happy.,1
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred  not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.,0
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly.,1
I know because I live nearby.,1
The pizza here is delicious.,1
My entire family was horrified.,0
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.,1
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well  I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!,1
For great chinese food nearby  you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.,1
But who says Murray's is anything about service.,1
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant  the food.,1
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.,1
Hats off to the chef.,1
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.,0
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy  black  antique-seeming teapot  for one) in the restaurant experience.,1
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.,1
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap  frozen  shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.,1
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.,1
service is friendly  and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.,1
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe.,1
Check it out,1
First off  the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.,0
Don't go.,0
The food was bland oily.,0
But they do.,1
What is even better  is that the prices are very affordable as well  and the food is really good.,1
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.,1
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).,1
Suan has challenged this loyalty.,1
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza  the house salad  and a good bottle of wine.,1
And Kruno  the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across.,1
Ambiance and music funky  which I enjoy.,1
The food  drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.,1
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.,1
It's a really great deal  considering we got full off of four dollars.,1
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic  alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods  the tastes  the experiance.,1
Went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).,1
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend.,1
Last time I went here  the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.,0
Try the tandoori salmon!,1
I am completely hooked on this place  it is ridiculous.,1
Eating in  the atmosphere saves it  but at your desk  it's a very disappointing experience.,1
Granted the space is smaller than most  it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.,1
Have recommended the place to friends  always gets good response.,1
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.,1
I love the atmorphere @ peep!,1
Enjoy!,1
We weren't!,1
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.,1
(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).,1
It could have been handled better.,0
The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.,1
The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.,1
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!,1
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's  Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile  true love for his community  and let's not forget the Outstanding Pizza!,1
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.,0
The environment is romantic  but the food is horrible  the service is pathetic  and gabriella lies about everything she could.,1
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess  it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.,1
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.,1
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.,1
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.,0
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky.,0
So I've never actually been to M proper  but I've had it delivered a few times.,1
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants  this offers by far one of the best values for your money.,1
Frankly  when you compare what you can have here for lunch  versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city  there is no comparison.,1
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.,0
If you're craving for Haru's great food  especially the House Roll  but can't stand the wait building outisde  head across the street to their Sake Bar!,1
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters  a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles  cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.,1
The food is great.,1
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.,1
Lunch came with pickels and slaw  no extra charge.,1
Decent wine at reasonable prices.,1
All conveniently delivered right to the door.,1
even the wine by the glass was good.,1
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.,1
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price,0
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.,1
I also ordered the Change Mojito  which was out of this world.,1
Okay service.,1
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.,1
We were very pleasantly surprised.,1
The food was just awful  ATROCIOUS actually.,0
I will never visit this restaurant again.,1
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.,1
The anti-pasta was excellent  especially the calamari  as were the filling pasta mains.,1
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.,1
(or sister  in my case!).,1
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.,1
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order  but their food says I love you.,1
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special)  crab dumplings  assorted sashimi  sushi and rolls  two types of sake  and the banana tempura.,1
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant.,1
Don't go there!,0
Ok  so the servers wander around a little clueless  but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine  you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.,0
Good luck getting a table.,0
We picked it randomly  without a recommendation from someone who has been there  so we weren't sure what to expect.,1
Don't look down your nose at me like that...,0
Planet Thai is great!,1
The service is awful.,0
Just don't do it.,0
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.,0
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes  I can't wait!,1
Trust me  it will be great  and all of it will be devoured in no time.,1
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.,1
I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.,1
Finally!,1
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.,0
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food  but my friend who took me there is.,1
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.,0
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.,1
The pizza is good though.,1
bottles of wine are cheap and good.,1
You will not be disapointed at all.,1
Walk-ins are risky too.,0
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious  if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.,1
They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.,0
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.,1
word of advice  save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.,1
Very good service and very good prices.,1
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.,1
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu  present your meal  and attend to your needs.,1
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.,1
Our food was great too!,1
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person),1
The most annoying thing  though  is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.,0
Get your food to go  find a bench  and kick back with a plate of dumplings.,1
Please try the Filet Mignon  its just the most tender piece ever.,1
Everything we had was pretty good  but we have only been there once.,1
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria  but facing away from the bar when we turned back around  the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.,0
Something about them being busy with holiday party's.,0
The sake menu should not be overlooked!,1
I would highly recommend.,1
This place is great.,1
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.,1
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good.,1
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district  is truly an excellent find!,1
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.,0
The service  wine selection  ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.,1
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery  and wasn't all that impressed.,0
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.,0
We were seated promptly as we had reservations  however after that the service was slow.,0
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.,1
It's really also the service  is good and the waiters are friendly.,1
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.,1
The food was pretty good  but a little flavorless and the portions very small  including dessert.,0
We visit at least once a month.,1
It is set far from the small street it's on  and there is no traffic noise.,1
Also  the place is popular with families  so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals  come later at night to avoid them.,1
I'll keep this short.,1
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.,1
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.,1
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food  the ambience and wonderful service.,1
However  it's not worth a special trip.,0
Nice value.,1
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.,1
And it was quick which is very important.,1
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.,1
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.,1
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).,1
But  nothing stands out about the cooking.,1
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.,1
If that's a problem  go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.,0
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).,1
I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.,1
I had their eggs benedict for brunch  which were the worst in my entire life  I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.,0
I work near-by  and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.,1
Always busy but fast moving.,0
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.,0
The menu looked good  except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass  but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.,0
Sexy.,1
The food was really good  I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.,1
I will have to say  this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.,1
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.,0
overall  a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine)  a solid deal as well.,1
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall  it's a bit intimidating at first  but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.,1
Based on the reviews for dinner  this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that  but definitely not for Dim Sum again.,1
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll  but the roll more than triples in size  and that's not just from the rice.,0
Even with John's and Joe's around the corner  this place will make a name for itself.,1
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy  creamy  and slightly buttery.,1
When he finally did  he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.,0
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.,1
The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh  and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).,0
despite the untasteful previous review...,1
Don't judge this place prima facie  you have to try it to believe it  a home away from home for the literate heart.,1
Sure  everyone's got their favorite  but to know Sal  is to know New York.,1
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.,1
Also they were $15 each!,0
The service is ok  some of the people didn't get what they asked for.,0
My friends spoke so much about it for months  I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.,1
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.,0
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.,1
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.,1
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.,1
If you want some roast duck  pork or chicken on rice with ginger  try them out!,1
You order from a menu  so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.,0
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.,1
We will go back every time we are in the City.,1
we love th pink pony.,1
So eat fast and order a lot.,1
Staff is very accomodating.,1
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.,1
--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons,1
If you were there when it first opened  give this restaurant a second chance.,1
I went to Del Frisco's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.,1
If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much  you'd better try Yokocho.,1
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me.,1
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.,1
You can't go wrong with this place.,1
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ).,1
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.,1
Not pretentious and very economical.,1
The food was terrific and the service classy  attentive  without being overbearing.,1
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.,1
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.,1
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip  and the food was delivered quickly  but we live only a few minutes walk from them.,1
Quick and friendly service.,1
Authentic bistro!,1
They are tasty  but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.,1
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.,0
It's true  this place is not cheap.,0
Try the hot dogs too  they're snappy and delicious.,1
Delivery is fast too.,1
Being from the south  there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.,1
The noise level was unbearable  conversation impossible.,0
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.,1
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.,1
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.,1
It's convenient.,1
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.,1
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.,1
Oh right  I should probably say something nice.,1
Odd for Ave B  not just odd  The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.,1
When we stumbled on Leon  we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT  we were certainly wrong.,0
Instead of wasting your time here: SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD.,0
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.,1
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent.,1
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st  taj mahal is also very comparable  in food quality  to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's.,1
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7  then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).,0
Try the cheesecake!,1
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.,0
David  Daytona Beach  FL,1
Perhaps.,1
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.,1
Go here.,1
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.,1
Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence.,1
Decor is nice and minimalist  food simple yet very well presented and cooked  and the wine list matches the food very well.,1
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine  for the price paid  I expected it to have some type of flavor.,0
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich.,0
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan  and the dals.,1
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.,0
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.,1
My wife and I always enjoy the young  not always well trained but nevertheless friendly  staff  all of whom have a story.,1
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.,0
What a great place.,1
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.,1
Don't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door.,0
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.,1
For the people who want great food plus great service  Roxy is a place to AVOID!,0
I had the best ravioli ever.,1
While the menu isn't especially groundbreaking  everything I've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty.,1
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding.,1
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.,1
Quite frankly  this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.,0
The food is great  service is ok.,1
The overall price tag was very very expensive  something I did expect.,0
By the time we were done  it was past 1:00am.,1
Spice is great Thai food  love the inexpensive appetizers.,1
Read all the other review  they'll confirm it.,1
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.,0
The service was attentive.,1
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella  but every pie is ultra fresh.,1
Fish was overdone.,0
Great idea and base for restaurant  but work on the details  people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.,1
When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular  hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.,1
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service.,1
I have been twice to this restaurant.,1
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.,1
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.,0
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style.,1
The rest of the dim sum  though pricey by Chinatown standards  is worth it.,1
Good food.,1
The wait staff is very friendly  if not overly efficient.,1
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.,1
The dim sum however was very good.,1
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.,1
Service has always been friendly and efficient.,1
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.,1
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.,1
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.,0
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.,0
Prices are very good.,1
We could not catch our waiter's eye  and he ignored us.,0
Fantastic place.,1
Plain and simple it's bad thai food.,0
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!,1
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.,0
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.,1
While certain staples are excellent (the burger  some of the pastas)  the food is not really the point.,1
The Dim Sum was so-so  but not spectacular.,1
The food was so-so.,1
The waitress  seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.,0
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints  and has a bar which deserves a mention.,1
What a ripoff!,0
Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier.,1
You can do it here.,1
Food-awesome.,1
good music  great food  speedy service affordable prices.,1
There was a small wait  but shorter than I expected.,1
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.,0
May  the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.,1
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.,1
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.,1
The sides were ok and incredibly salty.,0
It hits the spot every time,1
For some reason  all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.,0
Not a large place  but it's cute and cozy.,1
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.,0
and there's no way out.,1
The beverages were excellent  and the dessert was good.,1
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.,0
Next time  we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.,1
Please if your thinking about it go  and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.,0
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!,1
If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent  Long Tan is a good place on the slope.,1
When going out for a nice dinner  I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.,1
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City  I say  good - stay out.,1
Otherwise  this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere.,1
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service.,1
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.,0
A++ The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.,1
This is my fourth try over a two year period  and I'm done.,0
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass.,1
The music does get a little loud at times  but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife  and as I did  I got a whiff of corriander.,1
black white shakes came out good also.,1
It's simply the best meal in NYC.,1
Probably would not go again...,0
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.,1
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant  so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.,0
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.,1
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.,1
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya).,1
However  they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot.,1
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.,1
This is some really good  inexpensive sushi.,1
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread  but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.,1
I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy  too.,0
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.,0
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.,1
Also good for client lunch meetings  esp.,1
For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance.,0
The decor is dark  cool and soothing  while the food's presentation is spectacular  considering the low prices.,1
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.,1
The setting is casual and romantic.,1
IT WAS HORRIBLE.,0
Terrible  terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.,0
Great friendly service  Fast seating  Fast Delivery  Excellent sushi.,1
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.,1
The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES)  and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's  no matter how bad it look  you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...,1
As many other reviewers noticed  your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.,1
I found the food to be outstanding  particulary the salmon dish I had.,1
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.,1
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already  you know it's going to be good.,1
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.,1
Emilio  the owner  is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.,1
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.,1
Moules were excellent  lobster ravioli was VERY salty!,1
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged.,0
A cheap eat for NYC  but not for dosa.,0
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.,0
The seafood is amazing  there's a good wine list  and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.,1
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.,1
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).,1
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne  not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).,0
Really though  where's the seasoning?,0
The food was just OK  at least for what food was available.,0
by dinner time  they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!,1
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!,1
The ambience was nice  but service wasn't so great.,0
Solid wine list  knowledgeable staff  friendly owners and an adventurous  ever-changing menu keep us coming back.,1
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.,1
We didn't even see a menu  as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.,1
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.,1
otherwise  good stuff for late nite eats.,1
The dinner was ok  nothing I would have again.,0
It is thick and slightly soggy.,0
Its not the same if you have to sit inside.,1
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!,1
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta  panini's.....,1
Great people watching as others do the same to you.,1
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.,0
Two people in our party felt like something else  and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.,1
He offers subpar service and has no personality.,0
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly  she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.,1
I'm going back.,1
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....,0
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.,1
wow! how have i missed this one  tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.,1
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke)  but you will see.,1
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food  it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.,1
Me and my girls will definitely go back.,1
The first time the sushi was outstanding  the second time it was a little bland.,1
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.,1
delicious bagels  especially when right out of the oven.,1
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.,1
All the food was hot tasty.,1
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.,1
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.,1
Our server was very helpful and friendly.,1
Try green curry with vegetables.,1
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.,1
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!,1
This place was not ALL THAT!,0
First of all  this place is *not* romantic  as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.,0
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door  with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.,1
Much more reasonably priced too!,1
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant  drive to Corona.,1
The food was not very tasty  the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.,0
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.,1
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.,1
Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?,0
The Pad Thai is excellent here  as well.,1
Big and gawky on the outside.,0
I have been to Mary's many times and I like it.,1
Searching to get out from the cold  freezing weather  we went into what we thought was a deli.,0
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.,0
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!,1
This is the best thing in Soho.,1
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.,1
We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice  with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.,1
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.,1
For $760 for 2 people  it's a once in a lifetime experience.,0
The food is o.k.  but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.,1
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.,1
I think the stuff was better than Disney.,1
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant  I decided to give it a try with two friends.,1
While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive  in New York City  there is definitely better food in that range  and so Sapphire  despite it's lovely atmosphere  will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.,0
Orsay  is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.,1
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!,0
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.,0
Well  their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.,0
The staff is no nonsense.,1
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.,1
Wonderful at holiday time.,1
And really large portions.,1
The place is a lot of fun.,1
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff.,1
Have eaten at Ginger House several times  and it's always good.,1
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.,0
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday  and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.,1
I recommend the garlic shrimp  okra (bindi)  and anything with lamb.,1
As a Japanese native  I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years  but I was just so amazed at this place.,1
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was  we ended up going to Ping's three weekends in a row!!!,1
As we were leaving  the couple standing by the door said to another waiter  we're not in a hurry.,1
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger  to steak  to escargot.,1
In fact  two people could really share one plate.,1
The food is great and authentic.,1
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.,1
during happy hour!,1
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.,1
Love YUKA.,1
Anyway  the food is good  the price is right and they have a decent wine list.,1
Go  go  hurry  before everyone finds out about it.,1
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.,1
I am bringing my whole family back next time.,1
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.,1
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.,1
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.,0
But the coconut rice was good.,1
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.,0
A guaranteeed delight!,1
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.,1
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.,1
The food was great.,1
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.,1
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.,0
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.,1
Anyway  this is the last time I cross the williamsburg.,0
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.,1
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.,1
When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office  I head for Cafe St. Bart's.,1
Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.,1
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.,1
Besides  we were on vacation!,1
I love this cozy around the way Rest.,1
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap  stick to pork  fish  chicken  lamb and vegetables.,1
Don't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo.,1
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!,0
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City.,1
The place is a little tight and on a cold day  the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.,0
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).,1
But  they were too big for the bun.,0
The food is fresh  delicious  and reasonably priced.,1
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.,1
A few tips: skip the turnip cake  roast pork buns and egg custards.,0
The bagels are fabulous.,1
Oh yes  and they lie on the phone  claiming they have seating in the garden  then of course the seats are not available.,0
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.,1
The food was very good  a great deal  and the place its self was great.,1
The food options rule.,1
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.,1
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet  where greasy  dry and tasteless are complimentary.,0
We ate here in March  2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.,1
Definately check it out!!!,1
Probably much busier for lunch  it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).,1
Their calzones are horrific  bad  vomit-inducing  YUCK.,0
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.,0
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.,1
Saturday  Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us.,1
Good spreads  great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.,1
First  the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials  which I would have chosen had I known about them.,0
We will be back.,1
Also  top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.,1
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.,1
Check out the secret back room.,1
It's also attached to Angel's Share  which is a cool  more romantic bar...,1
Authentic food and they have REAL service  not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.,1
Stick to the gulab jamun.,1
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices  great atmosphere  good service and a wonderful wine list.,1
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.,0
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.,1
I was a little leary about Mary's at first - it's small  crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I'm glad I finally tried it.,1
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.,1
Also very inexpensive.,1
We've only eaten in the restaurant once  but we have ordered many times for dinner.,1
I got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!,1
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.,1
The food is great and reasonably priced.,1
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.,1
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!,1
Over the years the host  Vittorio  and his crew  have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does  it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.,1
The restuarant itself is not large  but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese.,1
My husband said he could've eaten several more  the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.,1
You cannot go wrong with this place.,1
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late  raucus dinner.,1
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare  the dishes are never a disappointment.,1
Prices are in line.,1
The combination of fresh tomato sauce  fresh mozz cheese  basil and the dough they make with imported flour  makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.,1
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.,1
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?,1
For all of you new to Indian food  try the Paneer Roll  it is a piece of heaven.,1
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.,1
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.,1
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.,1
The food is terrible and overall  I would have to say avoid at all costs.,0
I've been to this monster sushi twice  the 46th st once  the 23rd st one a number of times.,1
Unfortunately  the food was NOT something to get worked up about.,0
It's constantly open  catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St.  so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e.  surprisingly fresh).,1
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.,1
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre  steak frites  creme brulee) and it was marvelous.,1
The waitstaff were attentive  polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters.,1
Go inside and you won't want to leave.,1
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.,1
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes  however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top  like a salad.,1
Yes  the prices are high  but I felt it was worth it.,1
The large selection of bruschettas  paninis  tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.,1
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful  despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners.,1
While this isn't classical restaurant fare  the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.,1
The owner truly caters to all your needs.,1
He takes real pride in his food and his business.,1
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.,1
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.,1
So if you want a nice  enjoyable meal at Montparnasse  go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe.,1
Over the years  it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine.,1
I would go back tho.,1
The photobook menu was a cute touch  certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken  pork chop  and noodle dishes that we all ordered.,1
too large for just two people but nothing was left.,1
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.,1
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).,1
A pleasant surprise.,1
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!,0
If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.,1
We got most of it back at home with us.,1
Get there before 7pm.,1
very good breads as well.,1
if this happens  just ask for real naan.,1
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.,0
So  if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you  which is about 2 inches away  I would say try it.,1
Pizza is terrific  as is homemade pasta.,1
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.,1
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.,1
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.,1
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.,1
Service is not exactly five star  but thats not really a big deal.,1
There are other people waiting!,1
From beginning appetizers  the scallops were incredible  to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet  we were delighted by the taste sensations.,1
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT.,1
We left  never to return.,0
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.,1
No apologies during restaurant week.,0
My goodness  everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.,1
This place started off a little iffy  but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian  so I should know).,1
They also do a great job for restaurant week.,1
